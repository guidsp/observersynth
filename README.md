# Observer Synth

Observer is a simple plugin synth featuring four image based modulation sources. Each modulation source consists of a draggable "pole" over an image (shared by all four poles) around which rotate several cursors - one for each synth voice. Each cursor reads the brightness of the pixel it's over and generates a signal that can be used to modulate a variety of modulation destinations.
